First we will begin with my simple [Titanic using Name only model][10]. By carefully incorporating Ticket, Fare, and Pclass, we will raise its score to 83.3%. My model predicts survival for every boy in a family where all females and boys live. And it predicts perish for every female in a family where all females and boys died. It only makes 22 predictions. There are 396 passengers remaining in the test dataset. We will build an ensemble of Kaggle's top Titanic models to predict those.\n\n![tree5](http://playagricola.com/Kaggle/tree6.jpg)  \n\nModels included are:  \n* [Chris Deotte][9] - [Titanic using Name only [0.81818]][10] - scores 83.3%\n* [Konstantin Masich][1] - [Titanic [0.82] - [0.83] ][2]- scores 83.3%\n* [Shao-Chuan Wang][3] - [Titanic: ML tutorial on small dataset - [0.82296]][4] - scores 82.8%\n* [Tae Hyon Whang][5] - [Titanic Starter with XGBoost, 173/209 LB][6] - scores 82.8%\n* [Franck Sylla][7] - [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster][8] - scores 82.8%\n* [Oscar Takeshita][11] - [Divide and Conquer [0.82296]][12] - scores 82.3%  \n\n(To view a list of more Titanic models including non conventional ones, see Oscar Takeshita's [post here][13])\n[1]:https://www.kaggle.com/konstantinmasich\n[2]:https://www.kaggle.com/konstantinmasich/titanic-0-82-0-83/\n[3]:https://www.kaggle.com/shaochuanwang\n[4]:https://www.kaggle.com/shaochuanwang/titanic-ml-tutorial-on-small-dataset-0-82296/notebook\n[5]:https://www.kaggle.com/numbersareuseful\n[6]:https://www.kaggle.com/numbersareuseful/titanic-starter-with-xgboost-173-209-lb/notebook\n[7]:https://www.kaggle.com/francksylla\n[8]:https://www.kaggle.com/francksylla/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster\n[9]:https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte\n[10]:https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/titanic-using-name-only-0-81818/notebook\n[11]:https://www.kaggle.com/pliptor\n[12]:https://www.kaggle.com/pliptor/divide-and-conquer-0-82296/notebook\n[13]:https://www.kaggle.com/pliptor/how-am-i-doing-with-my-score"

[Jack Roberts][3] demonstrated that Tickets contain the same grouping information as Surnames in his kernel [here][4]. Using only Ticket or only Surname to form groups leads to mistakes. So for each passenger, let's form the concatenation GroupId = Surname + Pclass + Ticket + Fare + Embarked. Sometimes tickets of passengers traveling together differ in their last digit, so let's also remove the last digit of the Ticket. For example, let's change Mrs West's Ticket from 'C.A. 34651' to 'C.A. 3465X'. (I learned this cool trick to remove ticket digits in section 4.2.4 of [Erik Bruin's][2] notebook [here][1]). I purposely do not include SibSp and Parch in our GroupId because they contain many errors (as explained below).

Also the 5 top models unanimously agree on 8 females from the WCG to die. Then 4 out of 5 agree on two more females. Then 3 out of 5, and 2 out of 5, agree on the next 2 and next 2. The WCG model predicts that 14 females die. The top row shows that the main reason that the top 5 models have a great score is because they predict 16, 18, 20, or 22 of the winning predictions from the WCG model. This supports the idea that the WCG covers nearly all the predictive power in the best Titanic models.  \n\nThe bottom row show that the top 5 models cannot agree on which adult males should live. 15 adult males only get 1 vote each from 1 of the ensemble's models. The top 5 models do agree on some female predictions. 4 out of 5 models agree that 8 particular females die. And 3 out of 5 models agree on 5 females dying. Since the Mega Model has a threshold of 3, those 13 = 8 + 5 females are the only predictions taken from the top 5 models. The Mega Model uses those 13 predictions and the 22 predictions from the WCG.  \n\n## B5. Ensemble performance\n\nAnother interesting observation is how the overall ensemble performs better than any model individually or combination of models. I know this is a common data science idea but it's cool to see in action. Here is a table showing scores of different model combinations:  \n`Chris + Ensemble = 84.2% (threshold = 3)\nChris + Ensemble = 83.8% (threshold = 4)\nChris + Konstantin = 83.8%\nChris + TaeHyon = 83.8%  \nGenderModel + Ensemble = 83.8% (threshold = 3)  \nChris + Ensemble = 83.3% (threshold = 2)\nChris + GenderModel = 83.3%\nChris + ShaoChuan = 82.8%\nChris + Oscar = 82.3%`  \n  \nThis is a neat example of how ensembles help correct errors made by individual models. However, even with self correction, our ensemble only made its 13 predictions with 65% accuracy. (Those 13 predictions increased our score from 83.3% to 84.2% therefore most probably 8.5 were correct and 4.5 were wrong since 1% = (8.5-4.5)/418 ). So there is room for growth in predicting the fates of non-woman-child-group passengers."

Meet the surviving Wilkes, Hocking, Richards family\nAfter submitting this solution, it was brought to my attention by [Reinhard][1] and [Erik Bruin][3] that I missed a woman-child-group. In both [Reinhard's kernel][2] and [Erik's kernel][4], a meticulous job of identifying all the families aboard the Titanic was done. One thing they used that I forgot was maiden names. They also used SibSp and Parch.\n![Wilkes](http://playagricola.com/Kaggle/Wilkes.jpg)\n\nMrs James Wilkes (Ellen Needs), passenger 893, has a sister as indicated by her SibSp=1 and maiden name. Her sister is Mrs. Elizabeth Hocking (Eliza Needs), passenger 775. Mrs. Hocking has 3 children. Unless you consider her maiden name, you will miss finding her daughter, passenger 438, Mrs. Sidney Richards (Emily Hocking). Mrs Richards has 2 boys, Master George and Master William. Mrs Richards also has 1 sister, Miss Ellen Hocking, and 1 brother Mr. Richard Hocking.  \n\nMrs. Hocking's husband is not aboard the Titanic. And Mrs Richards' husband is not aboard the Titanic. Everyone's ages are 54, 47, 24, 23, 20, 3, 0.83. This is a group of grand parents, parents, and children traveling together. It is a large woman-child-group consisting of 4 females and 2 boys. This group survives. Therefore the WCG model predicts that the 2 unknown passengers Mrs. Wilkes 893 and Miss Hocking 944 survive. As such, the ensemble can not change the predictions cast by the WCG. Therefore female passenger 893 should be predicted to live.\n[1]:https://www.kaggle.com/reisel\n[2]:https://www.kaggle.com/reisel/save-the-families/notebook\n[3]:https://www.kaggle.com/erikbruin\n[4]:https://www.kaggle.com/erikbruin/titanic-2nd-degree-families-and-majority-voting"

I reviewed all the other maiden names with SibSp, and Parch. Some families get combined but only one other prediction changes. The WCG should predict that passenger 1251 Mrs. Edvard Lindell dies. She's passenger 252 Mrs Strom's sister linked by the maiden name Persson and Mrs. Strom died. I submitted the updated CSV to Kaggle but the public score stays at 84.7%. Most likely this change increases our private score. Thanks guys.\n[1]:https://www.kaggle.com/reisel\n[2]:https://www.kaggle.com/erikbruin"

      "source": "\n# Part C: Conclusion\n\nIt was fun to explore the groups aboard the Titanic very precisely and see once again that woman and children were prioritized and they stuck together. We see that the males aboard the Titanic tried hard to rescue all the woman and children before themselves. The woman-child-group model scores 83.3% by itself when it is implemented precisely using all columns of the data. We see that the best models have something to contribute in addition to the woman-child-group model and brought our score up to 84.2%. It would be interesting to study exactly what patterns the other models detect in the data. Perhaps now that we're aware of the strong affect of woman-child-groups, we can remove it from the data and focus on optimizing the other predictors. Perhaps we can build a model with 85% accuracy or better. If anyone does this, please post your discovery as a comment here. Thanks!\n \nI was disappointed (and perhaps surprised) that we didn't achieve a higher score. I was thinking that the top 5 Kaggle Titanic models had discovered more patterns in the data besides what woman-child-groups predict. The gender model scores 76.6%, then the woman-child-group model raises that by 6.7% to 83.3%, and so far only another 1% raise has been discovered in the data. In this kernel we saw that the best models more or less predict that all adult males die. This is interesting. The test dataset contains about 40 adult males that survive. If someone could build a model that finds only a few of them, we could combine it with this model and achieve over 85%!!\n \nHere's an image from [the forum post][1] that suggested this kernel's strategy. It looks like we are half way between a great job and a fantastic job! There is still room for improvement. If we work together, perhaps we can accomplish a fantastic job! Thanks for reading my notebook and I look forward to your comments. \n \n ![second](http://playagricola.com/Kaggle/second.png)\n \n [1]:https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/57447\n [2]:https://www.kaggle.com/reisel"
